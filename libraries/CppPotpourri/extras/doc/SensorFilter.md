# SensorFilter

SensorFilter was named for its first use-case, but it is a general buffering and
filtering system that I've found many uses for.


## Usage example


#### Dependencies

  * This class needs StringBuilder for output. Excision of the print functions will eliminate the dependency.
  * The vector implementation of this class uses the Vector3 template.
